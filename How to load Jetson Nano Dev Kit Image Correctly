Recently I purchased a Jetson Nano Dev kit for lab test. 
But when I follow the Link from NVIDIA (top entry from google search): https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-2gb-devkit#write-windows

It won't work!  When I insert SD card after following up steps, Nano Dev kit would not load the OS image but boot into shell.
Tons of online complains from Jetson communities, Reddit et al. No solid and authorizied conclusion. 

Why? because the fw version is 4.61 from above NVIDIA link. 4.61 is stone age fw from NVIDIA. 
So how about the latest version jetpack6? I download the latest jetpack6; it did not work with Jetson nano dev kit neither. 


I tried couple solutions and finally reached a stable method to resolve this issue:

Step1: you need a brand new MicroSD card. Format it to exFAT format; either from Window format, or the SD card format tool provided in the mid of link from nvidia above

Step2: if you already messed up your MicroSD card, you won't be able to reformat it because exFAT format won't be able to show the MicroSD card. 
you need to use Windown Disk Manager to delet SD card partition, give it a new file system and then reformated. I used Disk Manager to format it to NTFS then use the SD card format tool to do the second format. 

Step3: download jetpack5.13 here: https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-sdk-513
Make sure you click "SD Card Image Method" ---> "Jetson Orin Nano Development Kit" in green color link 

Step4: Download, install, and launch Etcher; and use Etcher to load the zipped Jetpack5.13 above 

Step5: insert MicroSD card into Nano Dev kit. 
It would boot into screen to ask you config nano dev kit. You need a wiif connection so it could download necessary upgrade fw. 
After boot into OS; you need to reboot twice to correctly load all drivers and fw; Be patient when screen is black. Do not interrupt or power off when screen black. 


Fianlly, Good Luck!

Wish above could save your struggle, especially, for the first time user of Jetson Nano
